26 Aug 2011:
Fixed error where user requests lost password replacement and username doesn't
exist.
Copied required iLab source files to this project so that all necessary files
are available to rebuild the project.

Added the ability to upload a student class list and create user accounts from
that list. The passwords are 6 character alphanumic and are randomly generated.
Log into the UQ iLab ServiceBroker as 'superuser' and the 'Manage Users' webpage
gets presented.

26 Jul 2010:
Added timezone session variable with javascript in login.ascx.

24 Jul 2010:
Added CEIT logo.

10 Jul 2010:
Fixed up some style sheet problems with error message display. Removed unused
entries from the style sheet.

13 Jun 2010:
Updated webpages and styles sheets.

25 May 2010:
Move system message from home page into database. Hand-edit database to insert message.

24 May 2010:
The UQ ilab ServiceBroker does not need to duplicate the entire MIT ilab ServiceBroker.
It only needs to provide an interface for users to run experiments. That means
the webservice remains with the MIT build.

Removed all admin web pages and left two skeletons: ManageUsers and AdminServices.
Made username field 'disabled' on Account page.
